# Go Blockchain

This is a simpliified implementation of blockchain in Go. I found this project on the [project based learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning?tab=readme-ov-file#go) repository. This is purely a project to learn GoLang with.

The link to the site that the tutorial is on is [here](https://jeiwan.net/posts/building-blockchain-in-go-part-1/).
